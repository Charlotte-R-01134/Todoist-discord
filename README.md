# Todoist-discord
Simple rich presence file for todoist and discord

Requirements
- Python 3.9.2
- Todoist `pip install todoist`
- Pypresence `pip install pypresence`

1. Make a discord client on the discord dev portal
2. Go to rich presence tab
3. Add an image asset named todoist
4. Copy the client id under oauth - either to add when prompted or in main file
5. Go to todoist
6. Go to settings
7. Go to intergrations
8. Copy API token - either to add when promoted or in main file
9. Clone repo
10. Run either todoist-discord-no-info.py or todoist-discord.py

todoist-discord.py requires the api token and client id to be added to the source file
todoist-discord-no-info requires you to enter the api token and client id everytime the program is ran


**Will make a more refined guide later**
